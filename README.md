# Note_Taker

# Description

    The note taker is a useful application that allows you to take down important notes throughout the day and have them save to a sidebar so you don't forget them.

   You can add a note by first adding a note title/subject and then type the body of the note underneath. The app is great for students as well as professionals who have busy schedules.
